## Hi! 
----
Thank you for taking time to look at this work sample. This app is my personal site with the work sample added as a page at /truss. 


## Getting Started
----
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Then, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Navigate to [http://localhost:3000/truss](http://localhost:3000/truss) to see the work sample.

## Files to look at
----
The files to be concerned with are `pages/truss.js` (displaying the table of planet data) and `hooks/useFetch.js` (abstracting the fetch into a custom hook to help with loading and error states).

The app is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Next.js resources
----
To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.
