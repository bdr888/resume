Hi!

For the last 4-5 years I have been focused primarily on front-end development, and have become very comfortable with the technologies and patterns used to build great UIs and modern web applications.

In my next role I'm hoping to get away from that comfort and expertise, and challenge myself in other areas of web development. 

I'm specifically interested in infrastructure and DevOps. In my experience the most successful projects and the happiest teams work with a solid infrastructure foundation and CI/CD process. In my opinion nothing makes a bigger impact on delivery speed, and more importantly, the engagement and well being of a team. 

I'd love to be part of an organization that understands the positive effect a good platform can have on a person's day-to-day, and in-turn the massive benefit to the project and company.

The most succsessful team I have been on (measured by execution, efficiency, innovation, and happiness) was on a project that had a CI/CD process that sparked joy.

We used a trunk branching strategy (no release branches).
We ran pre-commit hooks that linted and formatted code, and ran unit tests (eslint, prettier, husky, lint-staged, react-testing-library).
We auto-deployed a review environment for each PR so the QA process was clean and easy, and so stakeholders could see and feel new features immediately (Gitlab's CI/CD tools, NGINX, and AWS).
We ran automated integration tests as a pre-requisite for merging a PR (Gherkin, Cucumber, Selenium, Docker).
We automatically deployed when a PR was merged to the main branch multiple times a day (Gitlab, AWS).

That platform made it so us front-end developers could focus on the interesting parts of our jobs. Friction to contribute was minimal, the feedback loop was so tight, and our stakeholders had confidence in our ability to deliver.

Since I left that project I try my best to implement those processes on every new project, and am hoping to find a position where I can focus on this full-time. 

I think these are some of the most interesting and impactful software problems to solve, and would love an opportunity to focus on them.

Thanks!





= Strengths

I strive to be an empathetic and direct communicator. I think I am good at distilling and translating technology concepts and issues into simple and understandable language for all audiences.
I know how to read a room (or zoom call), and focus conversations towards an outcome, summarize that outcome, and clearly assign resulting tasks so meetings can be productive.

I always try to create an accepting team environment with thoughtful communication and inclusive language and spirit. I celebrate everyone's work, and aim to be a servant leader.
I try to write succinct, direct, non-judgemental code reviews that emphasize that we are a team, that everyone's ideas and strategies are valid and welcome, and that it is the team's collective responsibility to deliver good code and good products.

I have a growth mindset. I think every obstacle is a chance to learn something new, and I relish opportunities to learn and grow.


= Interested in Truss

The way the job posting is worded meant a lot to me. The focus on learning with the support of experienced engineers sounds like a dream job in tech.
